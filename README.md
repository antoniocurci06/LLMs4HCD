# LLMs for the Human-Centred Design

This repository stores the data for the experiment performed with Large Language Models to determine their impact on the design of evaluation protocols for usability studies.

## Step 1: Prompt Creation
Starting from the objectives of the study, the prompt was refined iteratively by the researchers. 

## Step 2: Task Feasibility Analysis
The feasibility of the tasks was performed by three researchers who assigned a binary label (Yes/No) to each task, which indicates whether the task refers to a functionality that actually exists and is provided by the system. 

## Step 3: Interview with HCI Expert
The last step of the experiment consisted in carrying out a two-part interview with an HCI expert to gather insights regarding the tasks generated by the LLMs.
